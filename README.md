Each folder contain different problem within Deep learning .

Problem 1: is focused towards  logistic regression model using gradient descen and 5-fold cross validation

Problem 2 : is focused towards training neural network for multi-classclassification a moderately sized dataset.We will fix the regularizationstrength at 0.1 and learning rate also at0.1.


Problem 3 : is focused towards classify the test images by training a convolutional neural network using training images and labels, differences in accuracies is observed classify objects in color and grayscale mode. CIFAR-10 dataset is used for the problem.
